# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Mohit  

I started my coding journey with **JavaScript**, but these days, I mostly speak **Python** (it listens better). I enjoy building things that scaleâ€”both in code and in life (except my potato consumption; thatâ€™s already at max capacity).  

Currently, Iâ€™m a **Senior Software Engineer** at **Asato**, where I write **clean code, design scalable architectures,** and occasionally debug existential crises. Iâ€™ve been diving into **Machine Learning**, because why not let computers do the thinking for us?  

If it involves **code, potatoes, or a mix of both**, Iâ€™m in. ðŸš€
