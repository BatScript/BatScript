# Sup? I'm Mohit  

I kicked off my coding journey with **JavaScript**, but these days, I mostly speak **Python**—it’s just more agreeable. I love building things that scale, whether it’s software, ideas, or my to-do list (which, unfortunately, never shrinks).

Currently, I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** at **Asato**, where I write **clean code, design scalable architectures**, and occasionally debug existential crises. Lately, I’ve been diving into **Machine Learning**, because if computers are going to take over, I’d at least like to understand how.  

If it involves **code, potatoes, or a questionable mix of both**, count me in.

Go ahead, judge away... I’ll be over here optimizing something.
